    "# Predictive Policing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The industry of so-called \"data-driven predictive policing\" has been growing in recent years. People and organizations of all motivations have been pushing for better use of data to help police communities across the US. Some of the motivations for such technological approaches to polices are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a \"more fair\" police force using algorithms,\n",
    "2. Better allocating limited resources for cash-deprived cities,\n",
    "3. Making policing safer by using advanced diagnostic techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few specific examples of such projects are:\n",
    "1. Predicting whether a given traffic stop will need \"further investigation\" (a search, an arrest).\n",
    "2. Predicting how many traffic stops there will be in a given service area, during a given month-day-hour. With this knowledge, a police department will know how many officers to deploy to which areas for shifts throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these approaches start with good intentions. However, it can be seem like you're creating a good solution, while in fact your solution only achieves mediocre performance with unintended consequences. Being able to bring a critical eye to these models is of utmost importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, understanding *why* the predictions are what they are, is vital in the context of fundamental rights. For example:\n",
    "* If you were pulled over and an algorithm decides you should be searched (incorrectly), wouldn't you like to know why it decided on that action?\n",
    "* If a \"resource allocation\" algorithm decides to place police outside your home to give traffic tickets, wouldn't you like to know it's done for appropriate reasons? (e.g. there have been a disproportionate number of accidents at that location).\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been vigorous discussion in the media on this subject. A few introductory articles:\n",
    "* [predictive policing and civil liberties](https://slate.com/technology/2015/11/using-data-science-for-predictive-policing-has-serious-civil-liberties-drawbacks.html)\n",
    "* [Fairness in policing with data](http://www.bigdatadialog.com/fairness/mne5eiqeykqj4ksyley9uo72k41xwc)\n",
    "* [Big Data in policing (FBI)](https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/predictive-policing-using-technology-to-reduce-crime)\n",
    "* [Preemptive contact](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/us/police-program-aims-to-pinpoint-those-most-likely-to-commit-crimes.html?_r=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "A tricky, but vital, issue to deal with in this problem is that of \"feedback loops\". That is, when you take actions based on a model's suggestion, you will naturally have more information about what occurred from that action (as opposed to a non-action). This leads to confirmation bias. When you don't have feedback about your failure, your models behavior only gets reinforced, even if it's (in)actions are incorrect on a large portion of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicting a Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will train a model to predict whether a given traffic stop results in a search. The context for how such a model is used might be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A police officer pulls over a driver and collects the driver's information (e.g. the data seen in our dataset, plus likely more). The officer then asks the model to \"diagnose\" the situation -- i.e. whether they should search the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will approach this as a classification problem: train a classifier to predict whether a given traffic stop resulted in a search. You will then analyze the resulting model's performance and the quality of the output (e.g. for 'fairness')."

    "\n",
    "The target we'll use in our classifier is the `searched` column. Before beginning training a model, you have to assess the quality of the target. The two relevant properties of the search column are:\n",
    "1. The outcome we are trying to predict is relatively rare. This makes it harder find the patterns to learn. Verify for yourself the proportion of traffic stops that results in a search.\n"

    "2. The target column has NULL values that we either need to drop or impute. For either of these ways forward, we need to understand the consequences of our actions (e.g. did we introduce bias? in what way?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to what we saw in project 01, the `searched` field is likely 'Missing at Random', conditional on `service_area` and `race_code`. The dependence on `race_code` is largely attributable to White (W) and Hispanic (H) values, which is in-turn correlated to the dependence on `service_area` (and the proximity to county borders and border control checkpoints).\n",
    "\n",

    "Since there is randomness involved in the imputation, the \"right thing\" would be to perform our prediction analyses multiple times for *multiple imputations* and analyze the variance of our predictions.\n",

    "Now that we know that our model isn't much better than a constant model, we can work on improving it! Since our model doesn't have much more than a few one-hot encoded nominal features, let's try to put a little more work into feature engineering.\n",

    "Recall from Homework 4 that *conditional additive smoothing* interpolates between an observed empirical rate of occurrence and a baseline rate. Here we want to generate features that encode a categorical feature that has some *prior knowledge* of the search rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ p_i = \\frac{b_i + \\alpha\\cdot(b/N)}{x_i + \\alpha} \\qquad {\\rm (smoothed)}$$\n",

    "    - an attribute called `self.srate` which contains the overall search rate in `X` (a float).\n",
    "    - an attribute called `self.smdists` which is a dictionary of dictionaries. `self.smdists` stands for smoothed distributions, is keyed by the columns of `X`, and contains a dictionary `{val:rate}` where `val` are the distinct values of the column and `rate` is the search rate of those stops with that value.\n",
    "* `AdditiveSmoother.transform(X)` returns the encoded smoothed search rates for each column in `X`. If a value occurs in a column of `X` that isn't contained in `self.smdists`, then it should return the overall search rate (`self.srate`).\n",
